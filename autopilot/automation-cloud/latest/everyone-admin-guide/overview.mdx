Installing Autopilot installs and deploys the Autopilot solutions package in the [Solutions](https://docs.uipath.com/solutions-management/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/solutions-management-overview) tab in Orchestrator. Once installed, the Autopilot solution deploys the following Orchestrator artifacts:

- In Orchestrator, in the selected tenant, look for the Autopilot folder. It should have several subfolders, one for each of the default automation toolset that Autopilot delivers.
- In the Autopilot folder, navigate to the **Automations** tab > **Processes** page. It should list the processes for the default automations.

Installing Autopilot for Everyone also installs the Enterprise version for [Clipboard AI](https://docs.uipath.com/clipboard-ai/standalone/latest/user-guide/introduction). For Automation Cloudâ„¢ Public Sector customers, ClipboardAI capabilities are unavailable.
