title: High Availability - Three Availability Zones
description: Kubernetes is designed to run a single cluster across multiple availability zones. To ensure resiliency against a zone failure, you can deploy critical components, including kubernetes and uipath product services, in High Availability (HA) mode.
---

HA mode requires at least three server nodes deployed in three distinct availability zones.

<Info>
Availability zones can be generalized as data centers. Clusters spanned across multiple data centers are more highly available than all availability zones in the same data centers.

### Requirements
To ensure HA with three availability zones, the following requirements must be met:

- Three availability zones that are geographically separate but within close proximity;
- Round Trip Time (RTT) among the availability zones must be minimal (`<10 ms RTT`);
- All availability zones must provide a consistent set of resources with HA and redundancy;
- Single virtual network span across all the availability zones.

<Note>
High Availability Add-On (HAA) is required for deploying Orchestrator in a three active availability zone topology on Automation Suite.
