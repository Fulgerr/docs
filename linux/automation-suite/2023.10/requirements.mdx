title: Root privileges requirements
description: You need root privileges (sudo su) to deploy Automation Suite. The following sections describe the specific components that require root access and why they require it.
---
## Node configuration
The following components require root access to configure the machines to install Automation Suite. This is required because the default partitioning structure on RHEL machines is not suitable for installing Kubernetes. All of these components are required on all nodes.

| Component | Why is root required to execute? |

| parted | Required to update the partition structure. |
| pvresize | Required to resize physical volume. |
| lvextend | Required to extend logical volume. |
| xfs\_growfs | Required to expand an XFS filesystem. |
| mkfs.ext4 | Required to build a Linux filesystem. |
| mount | Required to mount a filesystem. |

## Deployment
The following components are required to execute the Automation Suite installer at the time of installation. All Linux components require root to be installed.
