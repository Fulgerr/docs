## Introduction

UiPath® is committed to make its products usable and accessible for everyone. We are constantly working to develop inclusive technology by bringing accessibility improvements with each release.

We currently follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), aiming to comply with the [Section 508](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/) in the US, and the European Accessibility Act.

To assist customers, UiPath publishes every year updated Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) with the status of our products against the criteria of WCAG 2.2 and implicitly of Section 508, European Accessibility Act or any other national legislation that is based on the international standard.

## Accessibility Audit


We audit our products with an external accessibility specialized vendor who supports us in checking our products against the **WCAG 2.2** requirements and with issuing the **Voluntary Product Accessibility Template** certificate. The vendor’s testing team is **CPACC** (Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies), WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist), and [Trusted Tester v5](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester) certified. During the accessibility audit, the most common user scenarios are tested. UiPath aims to achieve and maintain level **A** and A**A** conformance, as defined by **WCAG 2.2**, for all UiPath products.

For a full overview of the ACRs of our products visit [Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)](https://docs.uipath.com/overview/other/latest/overview/accessibility-conformance-report-acr).
