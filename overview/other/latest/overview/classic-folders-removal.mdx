## Timeline

These are the steps that we have taken towards removing classic folders and all their associated objects.

**October 2021** - We announced the [deprecation](https://docs.uipath.com/overview/other/latest/overview/deprecation-timeline#deprecated-features-or-capabilities-2) of classic folders.

**April 2022** - We announced the [removal](https://docs.uipath.com/overview/other/latest/overview/deprecation-timeline#upcoming-removals-3) of classic folders.

**October 2022** - We launched a [wizard](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/standalone/2022.10/user-guide/migrating-from-classic-folders-to-modern-folders) which assists in the migration of classic folder objects to modern folders, while keeping the existing structures and hierarchies.

**April 2023** - We disabled executions in classic folders.

**October 2023** - We removed classic folders altogether. See the **Orchestrator versions 2023.10 and above** section for details.

## Orchestrator versions 2023.10 and above

Classic folders and all their associated objects are removed.

### Installing Orchestrator 2023.10

Fresh installs are automatically free of classic objects.

### Upgrading to Orchestrator 2023.10

If you are planning on upgrading to this version, and your database contains any classic objects, the setup process stops with the following error message: `This Orchestrator version does not support Classic Folders and Classic                         Robots. Please migrate your installation to Modern Folders, delete your existing                         Classic Folders before upgrading.`

As such, you must:

- Download anything you might need from your existing classic folders.
- [Migrate](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/standalone/2023.4/user-guide/migrating-from-classic-folders-to-modern-folders) your classic folders to modern folders.
- Delete all existing classic folders before starting the upgrade.
