<Warning>
Important:

Starting with 2024, to enhance the innovation we bring with each update, we simplified our release approach. We moved to a **single Long-Term Support (LTS) release** every year for on-premises products. See the blog post about [simplifying the update cycle with annual self-host release](https://www.uipath.com/blog/product-and-updates/simplifying-update-cycle-with-annual-self-host-releases).
</Warning>

## On-premises products


Self-hosted server products run with [UiPath Automation Suite](https://www.uipath.com/product/automation-suite), or as standalone server products, such as UiPath Orchestrator. UiPath desktop products include Studio, Assistant, and Robot.

We offer one annual release for self-hosted server delivery options and desktop products, usually in October.

However, there may be interim releases for desktop products to take full advantage of new capabilities otherwise available only in Automation Cloud™.

## Automation Cloud™

UiPath Automation Cloud™ is a Software as a Service hosted by UiPath. It offers a comprehensive overall set of features and is constantly evolving, with releases approximately every two weeks.

Refer to the Automation Cloud documentation for more information on [feature roll-out](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-cloud/automation-cloud/latest/admin-guide/feature-rollout).
