Automation Cloud<sup class="ph sup">TM</sup> Dedicated allows you to select the Azure cloud region where your data is stored. When onboarding, choose the cloud region where you want to deploy your Automation Cloud<sup class="ph sup">TM</sup> Dedicated instance. Some Azure regions may have limited features or hardware availability, such as GPU, and as a result, we may not able to deploy Automation Cloud<sup class="ph sup">TM</sup> Dedicated instances to those regions.

For more information on Azure regions availability, contact your UiPath account team.

## Safe deployment practices

We consistently deploy new releases every two weeks for cloud products and services, adhering to the company's safe and secure deployment practices.

Initial deployment is made available first to our multi-tenant Automation Cloud community users where applicable, and later to enterprise and Automation Cloud Dedicated customers.
