title: Automation Suite Overview
description: Automation Suite enables you to deploy the complete UiPath® automation platform on containerized platforms such as AKS, a managed Kubernetes service offered by Azure, or EKS provided by Amazon AWS.

While these platforms offer robust options, Automation Suite is compatible with other environments as well:

- If you are interested in deploying Automation Suite in an OpenShift environment, see [Automation Suite on OpenShift Installation Guide.](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2024.10/installation-guide-openshift/automation-suite-overview)
- If you are looking for our classic deployment experience in a Linux environment, see [Automation Suite on Linux Installation Guide](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2024.10/installation-guide/automation-suite-overview).

For an in-depth perspective on each deployment model, see [Cross-deployment model feature comparison](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2024.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/cross-deployment-model-feature-comparison).

### Automation Suite includes:

- **The UiPath® server products**, with the exception of any new products shipping in Automation Cloud first.
- **All shared suite capabilities** that enable you to easily configure the integration with existing enterprise systems, such as AD, AAD, or SAML, across all products; a common experience is offered across the suite for the user, tenant, external applications, and license management.
- **Common end-user portal**.

This guide provides documentation for installing Automation Suite on your EKS or AKS cluster.
