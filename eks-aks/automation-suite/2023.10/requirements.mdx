title: Kubernetes cluster and nodes

## Dedicated cluster
You can bring your own Kubernetes cluster from Azure or AWS and follow your standard practices to provision and manage it. Automation Suite requires a **dedicated cluster with cluster admin privileges** because it deploys the entire UiPath® business platform, and it comprises many UiPath® products that include many micro-services.

## Supported EKS/AKS versions

Each Automation Suite Long-Term Support release comes with a compatibility matrix. For compatible EKS or AKS versions, see [Compatibility matrix](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2023.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/compatibility-matrix).

We tested Automation Suite compatibility with the following Linux OSes:

| Cloud provider | OS |
| --- | --- |
| AKS | - Ubuntu 22.04 and 18.04 |
| EKS | - Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023 for all EKS versions - RHEL 8.8 for EKS 1.27 - Bottlerocket 1.19.2 |

Automation Suite on EKS/AKS only supports the x86 EKS/AKS architecture, and does not support ARM64.

## Node capacity

To estimate node capacity based on your product and scale requirements, use the [UiPath Automation Suite Install Sizing Calculator](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2023.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/capacity-planning).

The root volume requirement for agent (worker) nodes is 256 GB.

At a minimum, to start with the mandatory platform services (Identity, licensing, and routing) and Orchestrator, you must provision 8 vCPU and 16 GB RAM per node.

<Note>
We do not recommend using spot instances in Automation Suite in production scenarios, due to stability and performance issues.
</Note>

## Swap memory

You must disable swap memory before installing Automation Suite. Swap memory is known to cause issues with container workloads. Additionally, Automation Suite workloads do not benefit from using swap memory, and Kubernetes already optimizes memory usage.

## Autoscaling


We recommend enabling autoscaling on your cluster to ensure high reliability and to avoid business interruptions.

## Additional Task Mining requirements

If you install Task Mining, you must provision additional worker node(s) with 20 vCPU and 60 GB RAM. This node must be tainted to ensure only Task Mining workloads run on it. For details, see the [Node scheduling](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2023.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/kubernetes-cluster-and-nodes#node-scheduling) section.

## Additional Automation Suite Robots requirements
Automation Suite Robots require additional worker node(s).

The hardware requirements for the Automation Suite Robots node depend on the way you plan to use your resources. In addition to the additional agent node requirements, you also need a minimum of **10 GB to enable [package caching](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2023.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/configuring-inputjson#automation-suite-robots-specific-configuration)**.

For details, see [Storage](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/automation-suite/2023.10/installation-guide-eks-aks/storage#file-storage) documentation.

The following sections describe the factors that impact the amount of hardware the Automation Suite Robots node requires.

### Robot size
The following table describes the required CPU, memory, and storage for all robot sizes.

| Size | CPU | Memory | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 0.5 | 1 GB | 1 GB |
| Standard | 1 | 2 GB | 2 GB |
| Medium | 2 | 4 GB | 4 GB |
| Large | 6 | 10 GB | 10 GB |

### Agent node size

The resources of the Automation Suite Robots agent node have an impact on the number of jobs that can be run concurrently. The reason is that the number of CPU cores and the amount of RAM capacity are divided by the CPU/memory requirements of the job.

For example, a node with 16 CPUs and 32 GB of RAM would be able to run any of the following:

- 32 Small jobs
- 16 Standard jobs
- 8 Medium jobs
- 2 Large jobs

Job sizes can be mixed, so at any given moment, the same node could run a combination of jobs, such as the following:

- 10 Small jobs (consuming 5 CPUs and 10 GB of memory)
- 4 Standard jobs (consuming 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory)
- 3 Medium jobs (consuming 6 CPUs and 12 GB of memory)

### Kubernetes resource consumption

Given that the node is part of a Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes agent present on the server (kubelet) consumes a small amount of resources. Based on our measurements, the kubelet consumes the following resources:

- 0.6 CPU
- 0.4 GB RAM

A node similar to the one previously described would actually have approximately 15.4 CPUs and 31.6 GB of RAM.

### Automatic machine size selection

All your cross-platform processes have the **Automation Suite Robots** option set to **Automatic** by default. This setting selects the appropriate machine size for running the process using serverless robots.

When automatically choosing the size, the criteria listed in the below table are evaluated in order. As soon as one criterion is satisfied, the corresponding machine size is chosen and the remaining criteria are not evaluated.

| Order | Criterion | Machine size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Remote debugging job | Medium |
| 2 | Process depends on [UI Automation](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/ui-automation)  OR  Process depends on the [UiPath Document Understanding activities](https://docs.uipath.com/document-understanding/docs/activities-packages) | Standard |
| 3 | Other unattended process | Small |
