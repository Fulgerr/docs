title: Automation Suite Overview
description: Automation Suite enables you to deploy the UiPathÂ® business automation platform in your environment of your choice. Depending on your needs, you can deploy the platform on Linux servers (bare-metal or virtual machines) in your data center or public cloud (Azure, AWS, or GCP), or on your Kubernetes clusters in Amazon Web Services (Elastic Kubernetes Service) or Microsoft Azure (Azure Kubernetes Service).

### Automation Suite includes:

- **All Server Products** (except for any new products shipping in Automation Cloud first).
- **All Shared Suite Capabilities** that enable you to easily configure the integration with existing enterprise systems, such as AD, AAD, or SAML, across all products; a common experience is offered across the suite for the user, tenant, external applications, and license management.
- **Common end-user portal**.

This guide provides documentation for installing Automation Suite on your EKS or AKS clusters.
